# Project Status

I am still developing this project. As of September 2020, the app supports the following features: 
* creating and deleting cards and columns
* editing card and column titles
* adding descriptions to cards
* moving cards and columns with drag-and-drop
* filtering cards by title

Upcoming features:
* auth0 user authentication
* a card labeling system

Following best practices, I also plan to write a Cypress testing suite.
